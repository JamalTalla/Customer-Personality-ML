Customer Personality
We aim to gain insights into the behavioral patterns, preferences, and characteristics of customers. 
By analyzing various data sources such as demographic information, purchase history, and online interactions,
this project seeks to identify distinct customer segments and understand their unique personalities. 
Through advanced analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms, it aims to provide valuable insights 
for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
